# Run Trak App
For this project my goal was to create a basic application, in this case a run
tracker, that would allow the user to view community runs, log in, add, edit,
and delete runs. Each run would have an ID, a date of the run, and the distance
as well as pace and short description.

## Planning and Development
My plan for this application was to make a user friendly tracker for runs.
As a running enthusiast, having a community of runners who can track and share
their progress together, can really help motivate you in your fitness journey!


I set out to break down my work into segments, starting with the planning and
design and then knocking out the authentification of the users. After that
I was able to complete the run API with only a few minor bumps. As I went on
there were choices I made that I would probably not make again, but it was
all part of build process.

## Unsolved Problems
As we all do, I had high hopes for this project and set out to create some
really cool components. I wasnt able to knock out every option I set out to
implement, but I got every core aspect completed which I am happy with.

My future goals for this project would be:
  - Mobile friendly (improve dynamic nature of the UI)
  - Add community run feature to frontpage
